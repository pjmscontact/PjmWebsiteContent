		"description": "Chris Hedges, an American Pulitzer-Prize-winning journalist, author and commentator was interviewed by David Marr on the ABC Radio National on October the 20th to discuss the media bian on Palestine and Gazxa Genocide. During the interview, Marr constantly attempted to undermine and trivialise Mr Hedges' arguments rather than allowing him to elabourate on them. Such an unprofessional display of arrogance has no place in the honourable field of journalism. Sign this letter of complaint to the ABC.",
