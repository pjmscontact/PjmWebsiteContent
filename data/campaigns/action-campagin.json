		"title": "Send a letter of complaint to ABC Radio National - Request an Investigate David Marr and apologise to Chris Hedges and his millions of audience",
		"description": "Chris Hedges, an American Pulitzer-Prize-winning journalist, author and commentator was interviewed by David Marr on the ABC Radio National on October the 20th, in what can be only described as a debate where Marr constantly attempted to undermine and trivialise Mr Hedges' arguments rather than allowing him to elabourate on them. Such an unprofessional and grotesque display of arrogance has no place in the honourable field of journalism. David Marr must be investigated for violations and breaches of the ABCâ€™s editorial policies and guidelines. An apology must be issued to our American guest Chris Hedges. Sign this letter to help us acheive this goal.",
